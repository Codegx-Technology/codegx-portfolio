## 🔧 Branch Management

### Current Strategy:
```bash
main                    # Production (all features)
├── mobile-first        # Synced (mobile testing)
└── performance-optimization  # Synced (perf testing)
```

### Workflow:
1. Develop on `main`
2. Test mobile on `mobile-first`
3. Test performance on `performance-optimization`
4. Merge back to `main`
5. Deploy from `main`

### Cleanup (Optional):
```bash
# After confirming all synced, can delete feature branches
git branch -d mobile-first
git branch -d performance-optimization
git push origin --delete mobile-first
git push origin --delete performance-optimization
```

---

## ✅ Verification Commands

```bash
# Check branch status
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate -5

# Verify sync
git diff main mobile-first
git diff main performance-optimization

# Check what's deployed
git log origin/main -1

# Verify all features present
git log --oneline -10
```
