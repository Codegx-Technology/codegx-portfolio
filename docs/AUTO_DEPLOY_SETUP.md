---

## 🎯 **Enable Auto-Deployment**

### **Step 1: Access Netlify Dashboard**

1. **Go to your Netlify site:**
   - URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/codegx/overview
   - Or: https://app.netlify.com → Select "codegx" site

2. **Navigate to Deploy Settings:**
   - Click on **"Site configuration"** in the left sidebar
   - Click on **"Build & deploy"**
   - Or direct link: https://app.netlify.com/sites/codegx/settings/deploys

---

### **Step 2: Configure Build Settings**

#### **Build Settings Section:**

1. **Repository:** Should show `Codegx-Technology/codegx-portfolio`
   - ✅ Already connected

2. **Production Branch:** 
   - Set to: `main`
   - This is the branch that auto-deploys to production

3. **Build Command:**
   - Should be: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build:netlify`
   - ✅ Already in `netlify.toml`

4. **Publish Directory:**
   - Should be: `dist/public`
   - ✅ Already in `netlify.toml`

5. **Build Status:**
   - **Enable**: ✅ "Auto publishing"
   - **Enable**: ✅ "Deploy previews"
   - **Enable**: ✅ "Branch deploys" (optional)

---

### **Step 3: Deploy Contexts (Optional but Recommended)**

Configure different settings for different branches:

```toml
# Already in your netlify.toml, but here's what it means:

[context.production]
  # Builds from 'main' branch
  command = "npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build:netlify"
  
[context.deploy-preview]
  # Builds for pull requests
  command = "npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build:netlify"
  
[context.branch-deploy]
  # Builds for other branches
  command = "npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build:netlify"
```

---

### **Step 4: Environment Variables (Already Set)**

Your environment variables are already configured:
- ✅ `NODE_VERSION = "18"`
- ✅ `NPM_FLAGS = "--legacy-peer-deps"`
- ✅ `VITE_BASE_PATH = "/"`
- ✅ `NETLIFY_NEXT_PLUGIN_SKIP = "true"`

---

## 🔄 **New Workflow After Auto-Deploy**

### **Before (Manual CLI):**
```bash
# 1. Make changes
# 2. Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "your changes"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 4. Build locally
npm run build:netlify

# 5. Deploy via CLI
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist/public
```
**Total: 5 steps, ~3-4 minutes**

---

### **After (Auto-Deploy):**
```bash
# 1. Make changes
# 2. Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "your changes"
git push origin main

# ✨ That's it! Netlify automatically:
# - Detects the push
# - Runs npm install
# - Builds the project
# - Deploys to production
# - Notifies you when done
```
**Total: 3 steps, ~2-3 minutes**

---

## 📊 **Deployment Notifications**

### **You'll Get Notified:**
1. **Build Started** - When Netlify detects your push
2. **Build Progress** - Real-time build logs
3. **Build Success/Failure** - Final status
4. **Deploy URL** - Link to the deployed site

### **Where to See Status:**
- **Netlify Dashboard**: https://app.netlify.com/sites/codegx/deploys
- **GitHub**: Commit status checks
- **Email**: Deployment notifications (if enabled)

---

## 🎨 **Deploy Previews (Bonus Feature)**

### **For Pull Requests:**
When you create a pull request, Netlify automatically:
1. Builds a preview version
2. Deploys to a unique URL
3. Adds a comment to the PR with the preview link
4. Updates the preview on every commit

**Example Preview URL:**
```
https://deploy-preview-123--codegx.netlify.app
```

---

## 🔧 **Branch-Specific Deployments**

### **Development Branch:**
If you want to test on a separate branch:

```bash
# Create and switch to development branch
git checkout -b development

# Make changes and push
git add -A
git commit -m "test changes"
git push origin development

# Netlify creates a branch deploy at:
# https://development--codegx.netlify.app
```
